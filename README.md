## How Blog Posts Work

- Each blog post is a simple HTML file inside the `posts/` folder
- The homepage (`index.html`) links to each post
- No database, no CMS — fully static and transparent

To add a new post:
1. Copy an existing post file
2. Rename it (example: `second-post.html`)
3. Update title, date, and content
4. Add a new post card entry in `index.html`
