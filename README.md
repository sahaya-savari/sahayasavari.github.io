# Sahaya Savari — Python, Git & AI Blog

A high-performance, responsive personal learning blog and professional portfolio website built using React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. 

The site features a bold Neo-Brutalist editorial design, client-side dynamic search and categorization, and automated GitHub Pages deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Neo-Brutalist Aesthetic:** Flat colors, thick dark red borders (`#652929`), custom Display fonts for headings, and high-impact hard offset block shadows (`shadow-brutal`).
- **Client-Side Search & Filter:** Responsive article queries matching titles and excerpts, along with custom category toggles and pagination.
- **TOC & Markdown Rendering:** Custom Markdown-to-JSX parsing that dynamically formats blog content, slugifies headings for anchor links, and compiles a Table of Contents (TOC).
- **Service Worker / PWA Caching:** Built-in caching mechanisms to enable offline asset fallback and caching capability.
- **SPA Routing:** Configured with `react-router-dom` using `BrowserRouter` and local 404 redirection script decoding for GitHub Pages.
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Fully compliant semantic HTML templates, meta headers, Open Graph tag configurations, Twitter Cards, canonical URL mapping, and pre-built `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml` scripts.
- **Performance Optimized:** Route code-splitting via `React.lazy`/`Suspense`, manual vendor chunking in Vite, and lightweight vector graphics.
