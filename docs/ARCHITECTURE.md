# Project Architecture Documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md)

This document describes the high-level design, component boundaries, routing, state management, and deployment flow of the Sahaya Savari blog platform.

---

## 1. System Overview

The application is built as a single-page React application (SPA) compiled using Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages. It relies purely on client-side routing, static local data stores, and a custom Markdown parsing subsystem.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[Web Browser] --> |Request URL| CDN[Fastly Varnish Edge]
    CDN --> |Serves Built Artifacts| User
    User --> |Client Route Transition| Router[React Router DOM]
    Router --> |Resolves Component| Page[Lazy Page View]
    Page --> |Reads Static Records| Data[src/lib/data.ts]
    Page --> |Mounts Layouts| UI[Components Grid]
```

```

## 3. Client-Side Routing

The routing is implemented in [App.tsx](file:///D:/GITHUB/blog/src/App.tsx) using `BrowserRouter` and `Routes`. 
To optimize initial bundle sizes, all pages are lazy-loaded via code-splitting. A fallback loader (`LoadingSpinner.tsx`) is rendered while the bundle chunk is fetched in the background.

```mermaid
graph LR
    App[App.tsx Router] --> Home[Home.tsx]
    App --> Blog[Blog.tsx]
    App --> Details[BlogDetails.tsx]
    App --> About[About.tsx]
    App --> Contact[Contact.tsx]
    App --> NotFound[NotFound.tsx *]
```

---

## 4. Blog & Markdown Subsystem

Since the application does not make network requests to a CMS database, the data flow is fully static. Blog posts are stored as string arrays containing markdown text within [src/lib/data.ts](file:///D:/GITHUB/blog/src/lib/data.ts).

### Content Rendering Pipeline
When a detailed article is requested by slug:
1. `BlogDetails.tsx` imports the dataset array.
2. It selects the matched post object using the slug param.
3. A local parser iterates over the markdown body text to:
   - Extract raw text.
   - Generate unique IDs for headings to enable table-of-contents (TOC) page anchors.
   - Render lists, blocks, custom tables, and raw HTML safely.

```mermaid
graph TD
    RawMD[Raw Markdown String] --> Match[Filter post by Slug]
    Match --> ExtractHeadings[Extract ## Headings for TOC]
    Match --> CustomParse[Convert to React JSX Elements]
    CustomParse --> Render[Mount Blog Content View]
```

---

## 5. Routing Fallback (SPA Redirection)

GitHub Pages is a static file server. Direct navigation to sub-paths like `/blog` or page reloads will result in a 404 error because the server expects to find a static file at `blog/index.html`. 
To solve this, we use a redirection handshake:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Web Browser
    participant Server as GitHub Pages Server
    participant Redirect as public/404.html
    participant App as index.html (React App)

    User->>Server: Request direct path /blog
    Server-->>Redirect: Missing file! Serves 404.html
    Redirect->>User: Encodes path: /?//blog and reloads
    User->>Server: Request root URL with parameters
    Server-->>App: Serves index.html
    App->>User: Decodes query parameters and mounts /blog route in React Router
```

---

## 6. CSS & Tailwind Layering

The application uses Tailwind CSS inside [globals.css](file:///D:/GITHUB/blog/src/styles/globals.css) layered as follows:
- `@layer base` - Defines font defaults (`Inter`, `Playfair Display`), colors, and browser defaults.
- `@layer utilities` - Brutalist outlines, offset borders, custom marquee keyframes, and hiding scrollbars.

---

## 7. Deployment Pipeline

Deployments are strictly automated:
1. Every commit pushed to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions runner (`deploy.yml`).
2. The runner checks out code, runs `npm install`, runs `npm run build`, and generates the compiled output in `dist/`.
3. The build artifact is uploaded and deployed to GitHub Pages.
4. Custom domain `blog.sahayasavari.dev` is mapped automatically via the static `CNAME` file.
